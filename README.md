# Wildfire Risk Assessment

## Introduction
Wildfire Risk Assessment is an innovative project leveraging Canada's open-source forest wildfire data to advance prediction and risk management strategies. This tool is crucial for businesses and organizations involved in environmental safety, forestry management, and emergency response planning.

## Objectives
The project has two primary goals:
1. **Predict the Cause of Forest Fires**: Utilizing machine learning, the project aims to identify whether a fire is caused by human activities or lightning, refining response strategies and preventive measures.
2. **Predict the Probability of Fire Occurrence**: Forecasting the likelihood of fire occurrences based on location and time data, aiding in resource allocation and risk mitigation.

## Business Applications
- **Risk Management**: Enhance wildfire preparedness and response strategies.
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimize the deployment of firefighting resources.
- **Insurance and Finance**: Inform risk assessments for insurance and investment purposes.
- **Environmental Conservation**: Support proactive measures in forest management and conservation efforts.

## How It Works
- **Data-Driven Approach**: Leverages historical fire data and temperature records.
- **Advanced Modeling**: Employs machine learning for accurate and reliable predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to integrate into existing systems for real-time decision making.

## Get Started
- **Data Files**: `forest_fire.txt` contains the raw data needed.
- **Analysis Tools**: Access the Jupyter notebook `data_cleaning.ipynb` for data processing insights.
- **Models Used**: Using Random Forrest and Gradient Boosting to generate interpretable results.
- **Directories**:
   - `Prong1_Predicting_Unknown_Fires`: Contains models and scripts for predicting the causes of fires with unknown origins.
   - `Prong2_Predicting_Fire_Probability`: Houses models and scripts for calculating the probability of fire occurrences at specific locations and times.
